## Description

* Version of Classic Arcade Game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)
* Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Project Instructions

The task was to recreate a classic arcade game with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding player characters and enemies using objects and prototype inheritances.

## Run the Game

In order to run and play the game you can:

* Play [here](https://stearruda.github.io/fend-arcade-game/)
* Run locally by downloading, cloning or forking this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/stearruda/fend-arcade-game.git
    ```

## How The Game Works

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (or the arrows below the game) and move your player to the water without hitting the bugs!
Every time the player reaches the water another level starts and the score is increased.
If the player hits the bug looses one life and losing all lifes the game is over and have an opportunity to play again.
